2024-09-07 11:37:18 To compare the performance of different learning rate schedules on diffusion model performance, we can run experiments with the following learning rate schedules:
2024-09-07 11:37:18 
2024-09-07 11:37:18 1. **Cosine Annealing (Baseline)**: This is already provided.
2024-09-07 11:37:18 2. **StepLR**: Decreases the learning rate by a factor every few epochs.
2024-09-07 11:37:18 3. **ExponentialLR**: Decreases the learning rate exponentially.
2024-09-07 11:37:18 4. **ReduceLROnPlateau**: Reduces the learning rate when a metric has stopped improving.
2024-09-07 11:37:18 5. **CyclicLR**: Cycles the learning rate between two boundaries.
2024-09-07 11:37:18 
2024-09-07 11:37:18 We will implement these learning rate schedules in the `experiment.py` file and run the experiments one by one.
2024-09-07 11:37:18 
2024-09-07 11:37:18 ### Experiment Plan

2024-09-07 11:37:18 
2024-09-07 11:37:18 ### Step-by-Step Changes
2024-09-07 11:37:18 
2024-09-07 11:37:18 1. **Add a command-line argument to specify the learning rate schedule.**
2024-09-07 11:37:18 2. **Implement the different learning rate schedules in the `experiment.py` file.**
2024-09-07 11:37:18 
2024-09-07 11:37:18 Let's start with **Run 1: StepLR**.
2024-09-07 11:37:18

2024-09-07 11:49:09  Next, we need to implement the next learning rate schedule for Run 5. Since we

2024-09-07 11:49:09  can consider using a different learning rate schedule. However, if we have     
2024-09-07 11:49:09  exhausted all the planned schedules, we can re-run one of the previous schedul 
2024-09-07 11:49:09  with different parameters or configurations.

2024-09-07 11:59:45  Description: This plot shows the training loss over time for each dataset and  
2024-09-07 11:59:45  learning rate schedule. Each subplot corresponds to a different dataset (circl 
2024-09-07 11:59:45  dino, line, moons). The x-axis represents the training steps, and the y-axis   
2024-09-07 11:59:45  represents the loss. Different colors represent different learning rate        
2024-09-07 11:59:45  schedules as specified in the legend. This plot helps in visualizing how the   
2024-09-07 11:59:45  training loss evolves with each learning rate schedule and dataset.

2024-09-07 11:59:45  schedule), and each column corresponds to a different dataset (circle, dino,   
2024-09-07 11:59:45  line, moons). The scatter plots show the generated data points in 2D space. Th 
2024-09-07 11:59:45  plot helps in comparing the quality and distribution of the generated samples  
2024-09-07 11:59:45  across different learning rate schedules and datasets.

2024-09-07 11:59:55  In this paper, we investigate the impact of various adaptive learning rate     
2024-09-07 11:59:55  schedules on the performance of diffusion models, a class of generative models 
2024-09-07 11:59:55  that have shown promise in generating high-quality samples. The relevance of   
2024-09-07 11:59:55  this study lies in the critical role that learning rate schedules play in the  
2024-09-07 11:59:55  training dynamics and final performance of machine learning models. However,   
2024-09-07 11:59:55  finding the optimal learning rate schedule is challenging due to the complex   
2024-09-07 11:59:55  interplay between the learning rate, model parameters, and training data. We   
2024-09-07 11:59:55  address this challenge by systematically comparing several popular learning ra 
2024-09-07 11:59:55  schedules, including StepLR, ExponentialLR, and CyclicLR, in the context of    
2024-09-07 11:59:55  diffusion models. Our contribution includes a comprehensive experimental setup 
2024-09-07 11:59:55  and evaluation framework that measures the effectiveness of each learning rate 
2024-09-07 11:59:55  schedule using metrics such as training time, evaluation loss, inference time, 
2024-09-07 11:59:55  and KL divergence. The results demonstrate significant variations in performan 
2024-09-07 11:59:55  across different schedules, providing valuable insights for researchers and    
2024-09-07 11:59:55  practitioners in the field. Our experiments confirm that the choice of learnin

2024-09-07 12:00:38  Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models capable 
2024-09-07 12:00:38  of producing high-quality samples across various domains \citep{ddpm, edm}.    
2024-09-07 12:00:38  These models have shown significant promise in applications ranging from image 
2024-09-07 12:00:38  generation to data synthesis, making them a focal point of contemporary machin 
2024-09-07 12:00:38  learning research \citep{yang2023diffusion}.

2024-09-07 12:00:38  % Importance of learning rate schedules                                        
2024-09-07 12:00:38  A critical aspect of training these models is the learning rate schedule, whic 
2024-09-07 12:00:38  dictates how the learning rate changes over time during training. The learning 
2024-09-07 12:00:38  rate schedule can significantly impact the convergence speed and final         
2024-09-07 12:00:38  performance of the model. Despite its importance, selecting an optimal learnin 
2024-09-07 12:00:38  rate schedule remains a challenging task due to the complex interactions betwe 
2024-09-07 12:00:38  the learning rate, model parameters, and the training data.

2024-09-07 12:00:38  % Challenges in finding the optimal learning rate schedule                     
2024-09-07 12:00:38  The difficulty in finding the optimal learning rate schedule stems from the ne 
2024-09-07 12:00:38  to balance exploration and exploitation during training. Too high a learning   
2024-09-07 12:00:38  rate can cause the model to diverge, while too low a learning rate can result  
2024-09-07 12:00:38  slow convergence and suboptimal performance. This balance is further complicat 
2024-09-07 12:00:38  by the dynamic nature of the training process, where the optimal learning rate 
2024-09-07 12:00:38  may change as the model learns.

2024-09-07 12:00:58  Diffusion models have gained significant attention in recent years due to thei 
2024-09-07 12:00:58  ability to generate high-quality samples in various domains, such as image     
2024-09-07 12:00:58  generation and data synthesis \citep{ddpm, edm}. These models operate by

2024-09-07 12:00:58  diffusion models. It dictates how the learning rate changes over time, impacti 
2024-09-07 12:00:58  the convergence speed and the final performance of the model. Various learning

2024-09-07 12:00:58  In this study, we focus on the problem of optimizing the learning rate schedul 
2024-09-07 12:00:58  for training diffusion models. Formally, let $\theta$ represent the parameters 
2024-09-07 12:00:58  of the diffusion model, and let $\mathcal{L}(\theta)$ denote the loss function 
2024-09-07 12:00:58  The goal is to minimize $\mathcal{L}(\theta)$ over the training data           
2024-09-07 12:00:58  $\mathcal{D}$ by iteratively updating $\theta$ using gradient descent. The

2024-09-07 12:00:58  the learning rate at each step. Our objective is to find the optimal $\eta(t)$

2024-09-07 12:01:26  generation and data synthesis \citep{ddpm, edm}. These models operate by

2024-09-07 12:01:26  learned denoising steps, which makes the training of these models              
2024-09-07 12:01:26  computationally intensive and sensitive to hyperparameters, particularly the

2024-09-07 12:01:26  The learning rate schedule is a crucial hyperparameter in the training of      
2024-09-07 12:01:26  diffusion models. It dictates how the learning rate changes over time, impacti 
2024-09-07 12:01:26  the convergence speed and the final performance of the model. Various learning 
2024-09-07 12:01:26  rate schedules, such as StepLR, ExponentialLR, and CyclicLR, have been propose 
2024-09-07 12:01:26  to adapt the learning rate dynamically during training. These schedules aim to 
2024-09-07 12:01:26  balance the trade-off between exploration and exploitation, ensuring that the  
2024-09-07 12:01:26  model converges to a good solution efficiently.

2024-09-07 12:01:26  The goal is to minimize $\mathcal{L}(\theta)$ over the training data

2024-09-07 12:01:48  The diffusion model used in our experiments is a denoising diffusion           
2024-09-07 12:01:48  probabilistic model (DDPM) \citep{ddpm}. The model architecture includes a     
2024-09-07 12:01:48  sinusoidal embedding layer for time steps, followed by a series of residual    
2024-09-07 12:01:48  blocks. The model is designed to predict the noise added to the data at each

2024-09-07 12:01:48  training time, evaluation loss, inference time, and KL divergence. Training ti 
2024-09-07 12:01:48  measures the total time taken to train the model. Evaluation loss is the mean

2024-09-07 12:01:48  taken to generate samples from the trained model. KL divergence quantifies the

2024-09-07 12:02:40  % Overview of the experimental setup                                           
2024-09-07 12:02:40  In this section, we describe the experimental setup used to evaluate the       
2024-09-07 12:02:40  performance of different adaptive learning rate schedules for training diffusi 
2024-09-07 12:02:40  models. This includes details about the datasets, evaluation metrics,          
2024-09-07 12:02:40  hyperparameters, and implementation specifics.                                 
2024-09-07 12:02:40                                                                                 
2024-09-07 12:02:40  % Description of the datasets                                                  
2024-09-07 12:02:40  We use four 2D datasets: circle, dino, line, and moons. These datasets are     
2024-09-07 12:02:40  chosen for their simplicity and ability to visually demonstrate the performanc 
2024-09-07 12:02:40  of the diffusion models. Each dataset consists of 100,000 samples, and no      
2024-09-07 12:02:40  additional preprocessing is applied. The datasets are generated using standard 
2024-09-07 12:02:40  functions available in machine learning libraries.                             
2024-09-07 12:02:40                                                                                 
2024-09-07 12:02:40  % Evaluation metrics                                                           
2024-09-07 12:02:40  To evaluate the performance of the models, we use the following metrics:       
2024-09-07 12:02:40  training time, evaluation loss, inference time, and KL divergence. Training ti 
2024-09-07 12:02:40  measures the total time taken to train the model. Evaluation loss is the mean  
2024-09-07 12:02:40  squared error on a held-out validation set. Inference time measures the time   
2024-09-07 12:02:40  taken to generate samples from the trained model. KL divergence quantifies the 
2024-09-07 12:02:40  difference between the distribution of the generated samples and the real data 
2024-09-07 12:02:40  distribution, providing a measure of the quality of the generated samples.     
2024-09-07 12:02:40                                                                                 
2024-09-07 12:02:40  % Important hyperparameters                                                    
2024-09-07 12:02:40  The diffusion model used in our experiments is a denoising diffusion           
2024-09-07 12:02:40  probabilistic model (DDPM) \citep{ddpm}. The model architecture includes a     
2024-09-07 12:02:40  sinusoidal embedding layer for time steps, followed by a series of residual    
2024-09-07 12:02:40  blocks. The optimizer used is AdamW \citep{goodfellow2016deep}, with a base    
2024-09-07 12:02:40  learning rate of 3e-4. We experiment with several learning rate schedules:     
2024-09-07 12:02:40  StepLR, ExponentialLR, and CyclicLR. Each schedule is applied to adjust the    
2024-09-07 12:02:40  learning rate dynamically during training, aiming to balance exploration and   
2024-09-07 12:02:40  exploitation.

2024-09-07 12:02:40  % Implementation details                                                       
2024-09-07 12:02:40  The experiments are conducted on a standard machine with a single GPU. The     
2024-09-07 12:02:40  training process involves iteratively updating the model parameters using      
2024-09-07 12:02:40  gradient descent, guided by the chosen learning rate schedule. We train the    
2024-09-07 12:02:40  model for a fixed number of steps and evaluate its performance on the held-out 
2024-09-07 12:02:40  validation set. The implementation is done using PyTorch, and the results are  
2024-09-07 12:02:40  logged for analysis.

2024-09-07 12:03:16  distribution, providing a measure of the quality of the generated samples.

2024-09-07 12:03:16  The diffusion model used in our experiments is a denoising diffusion           
2024-09-07 12:03:16  probabilistic model (DDPM) \citep{ddpm}. The model architecture includes a     
2024-09-07 12:03:16  sinusoidal embedding layer for time steps, followed by a series of residual    
2024-09-07 12:03:16  blocks. The optimizer used is AdamW \citep{goodfellow2016deep}, with a base    
2024-09-07 12:03:16  learning rate of 3e-4. We experiment with several learning rate schedules:     
2024-09-07 12:03:16  StepLR, ExponentialLR, and CyclicLR. Each schedule is applied to adjust the    
2024-09-07 12:03:16  learning rate dynamically during training, aiming to balance exploration and   
2024-09-07 12:03:16  exploitation.

2024-09-07 12:03:16  The experiments are conducted on a standard machine with a single GPU. The     
2024-09-07 12:03:16  training process involves iteratively updating the model parameters using      
2024-09-07 12:03:16  gradient descent, guided by the chosen learning rate schedule. We train the    
2024-09-07 12:03:16  model for a fixed number of steps and evaluate its performance on the held-out 
2024-09-07 12:03:16  validation set. The implementation is done using PyTorch, and the results are  
2024-09-07 12:03:16  logged for analysis.

2024-09-07 12:03:51  learning rate schedules on diffusion models, there are several limitations to  
2024-09-07 12:03:51  our study. First, our experiments are limited to 2D datasets, which may not    
2024-09-07 12:03:51  fully capture the complexities of higher-dimensional data. Second, we only     
2024-09-07 12:03:51  consider a few popular learning rate schedules, and there may be other schedul 
2024-09-07 12:03:51  or combinations thereof that could yield better results. Future work could     
2024-09-07 12:03:51  explore these aspects and extend our findings to more complex datasets and     
2024-09-07 12:03:51  models.

2024-09-07 12:21:57 To evaluate the performance of the models, we use the following metrics: 
2024-09-07 12:21:57 training time, evaluation loss, inference time, and KL divergence. Training time
2024-09-07 12:21:57 measures the total time taken to train the model. Evaluation loss is the mean 
2024-09-07 12:21:57 squared error on a held-out validation set. Inference time measures the time

2024-09-07 12:21:57 difference between the distribution of the generated samples and the real data 
2024-09-07 12:21:57 distribution, providing a measure of the quality of the generated samples.

2024-09-07 12:21:57 \subsection{Hyperparameters}
2024-09-07 12:21:57 The diffusion model used in our experiments is a denoising diffusion 
2024-09-07 12:21:57 probabilistic model (DDPM) \citep{ddpm}. The model architecture includes a 
2024-09-07 12:21:57 sinusoidal embedding layer for time steps, followed by a series of residual 
2024-09-07 12:21:57 blocks. The optimizer used is AdamW \citep{goodfellow2016deep}, with a base 
2024-09-07 12:21:57 learning rate of 3e-4. We experiment with several learning rate schedules: 
2024-09-07 12:21:57 StepLR, ExponentialLR, and CyclicLR. Each schedule is applied to adjust the 
2024-09-07 12:21:57 learning rate dynamically during training, aiming to balance exploration and 
2024-09-07 12:21:57 exploitation.

2024-09-07 12:21:57 \subsection{Implementation Details}
2024-09-07 12:21:57 The experiments are conducted on a standard machine with a single GPU. The 
2024-09-07 12:21:57 training process involves iteratively updating the model parameters using 
2024-09-07 12:21:57 gradient descent, guided by the chosen learning rate schedule. We train the 
2024-09-07 12:21:57 model for a fixed number of steps and evaluate its performance on the held-out 
2024-09-07 12:21:57 validation set. The implementation is done using PyTorch, and the results are 
2024-09-07 12:21:57 logged for analysis.

2024-09-07 12:25:27  including various architectural and training choices. They highlight the       
2024-09-07 12:25:27  importance of hyperparameter tuning, including learning rate schedules, in     
2024-09-07 12:25:27  achieving optimal performance. Our study complements their work by providing   
2024-09-07 12:25:27  empirical evidence on the effectiveness of different adaptive learning rate    
2024-09-07 12:25:27  schedules.

2024-09-07 12:25:27  In summary, while previous works have acknowledged the importance of learning  
2024-09-07 12:25:27  rate schedules, our study provides a focused comparison of different adaptive  
2024-09-07 12:25:27  schedules in the context of diffusion models. By systematically evaluating the 
2024-09-07 12:25:27  impact on training dynamics and final performance, we offer valuable insights  
2024-09-07 12:25:27  that can guide future research and practical applications in this area.

2024-09-07 12:26:06  Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models capable 
2024-09-07 12:26:06  of producing high-quality samples across various domains \citep{ddpm, edm}.    
2024-09-07 12:26:06  These models have shown significant promise in applications ranging from image 
2024-09-07 12:26:06  generation to data synthesis, making them a focal point of contemporary machin 
2024-09-07 12:26:06  learning research \citep{yang2023diffusion}.

2024-09-07 12:26:06  % Importance of learning rate schedules                                        
2024-09-07 12:26:06  A critical aspect of training these models is the learning rate schedule, whic 
2024-09-07 12:26:06  dictates how the learning rate changes over time during training. The learning 
2024-09-07 12:26:06  rate schedule can significantly impact the convergence speed and final         
2024-09-07 12:26:06  performance of the model. Despite its importance, selecting an optimal learnin 
2024-09-07 12:26:06  rate schedule remains a challenging task due to the complex interactions betwe 
2024-09-07 12:26:06  the learning rate, model parameters, and the training data.                    
2024-09-07 12:26:06                                                                                 
2024-09-07 12:26:06  % Challenges in finding the optimal learning rate schedule                     
2024-09-07 12:26:06  The difficulty in finding the optimal learning rate schedule stems from the ne 
2024-09-07 12:26:06  to balance exploration and exploitation during training. Too high a learning   
2024-09-07 12:26:06  rate can cause the model to diverge, while too low a learning rate can result  
2024-09-07 12:26:06  slow convergence and suboptimal performance. This balance is further complicat 
2024-09-07 12:26:06  by the dynamic nature of the training process, where the optimal learning rate 
2024-09-07 12:26:06  may change as the model learns.

2024-09-07 12:26:06  popular adaptive learning rate schedules, including StepLR, ExponentialLR, and

2024-09-07 12:26:06  demonstrate that the choice of learning rate schedule can substantially        
2024-09-07 12:26:06  influence the efficiency and effectiveness of training diffusion models.

2024-09-07 12:26:42  Diffusion models have gained significant attention in recent years due to thei 
2024-09-07 12:26:42  ability to generate high-quality samples in various domains, such as image     
2024-09-07 12:26:42  generation and data synthesis \citep{ddpm, edm}. These models operate by       
2024-09-07 12:26:42  iteratively denoising a sample, starting from pure noise, to generate data tha 
2024-09-07 12:26:42  resembles the training distribution. The process is governed by a series of    
2024-09-07 12:26:42  learned denoising steps, making the training of these models computationally   
2024-09-07 12:26:42  intensive and sensitive to hyperparameters, particularly the learning rate.

2024-09-07 12:26:42  diffusion models. It dictates how the learning rate changes over time, impacti

2024-09-07 12:26:42  to adapt the learning rate dynamically during training. These schedules aim to 
2024-09-07 12:26:42  balance the trade-off between exploration and exploitation, ensuring that the

2024-09-07 12:27:13  To evaluate the performance of the models, we use the following metrics:       
2024-09-07 12:27:13  training time, evaluation loss, inference time, and KL divergence. Training ti 
2024-09-07 12:27:13  measures the total time taken to train the model. Evaluation loss is the mean  
2024-09-07 12:27:13  squared error on a held-out validation set. Inference time measures the time   
2024-09-07 12:27:13  taken to generate samples from the trained model. KL divergence quantifies the 
2024-09-07 12:27:13  difference between the distribution of the generated samples and the real data 
2024-09-07 12:27:13  distribution, providing a measure of the quality of the generated samples.

2024-09-07 12:27:13  We use four 2D datasets: circle, dino, line, and moons. These datasets are     
2024-09-07 12:27:13  chosen for their simplicity and ability to visually demonstrate the performanc

2024-09-07 12:27:13  Our experiments utilize a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM)       
2024-09-07 12:27:13  \citep{ddpm}. The model architecture includes a sinusoidal embedding layer for 
2024-09-07 12:27:13  time steps, followed by a series of residual blocks. The model predicts the    
2024-09-07 12:27:13  noise added to the data at each time step, which is then used to iteratively   
2024-09-07 12:27:13  denoise the samples.

2024-09-07 12:27:13  We train the diffusion model using the mean squared error (MSE) loss between t 
2024-09-07 12:27:13  predicted and actual noise. The optimizer used is AdamW                        
2024-09-07 12:27:13  \citep{Loshchilov2017DecoupledWD}, with a base learning rate of 3e-4. We       
2024-09-07 12:27:13  experiment with several learning rate schedules: StepLR, ExponentialLR, and    
2024-09-07 12:27:13  CyclicLR. Each schedule dynamically adjusts the learning rate during training  
2024-09-07 12:27:13  balance exploration and exploitation.

2024-09-07 12:27:13  To evaluate model performance, we use the following metrics: training time,    
2024-09-07 12:27:13  evaluation loss, inference time, and KL divergence. Training time measures the 
2024-09-07 12:27:13  total time taken to train the model. Evaluation loss is the mean squared error 
2024-09-07 12:27:13  on a held-out validation set. Inference time measures the time taken to genera 
2024-09-07 12:27:13  samples from the trained model. KL divergence quantifies the difference betwee 
2024-09-07 12:27:13  the distribution of the generated samples and the real data distribution,      
2024-09-07 12:27:13  providing a measure of the quality of the generated samples.

2024-09-07 12:27:44  StepLR, ExponentialLR, and CyclicLR. Each schedule dynamically adjusts the     
2024-09-07 12:27:44  learning rate during training to balance exploration and exploitation.

2024-09-07 12:27:44  The experiments are conducted on a standard machine with a single GPU. The     
2024-09-07 12:27:44  training process involves iteratively updating the model parameters using      
2024-09-07 12:27:44  gradient descent, guided by the chosen learning rate schedule. We train the    
2024-09-07 12:27:44  model for a fixed number of steps and evaluate its performance on the held-out 
2024-09-07 12:27:44  validation set. The implementation is done using PyTorch, and the results are  
2024-09-07 12:27:44  logged for analysis.

2024-09-07 12:28:39  While our experiments provide valuable insights into the impact of different   
2024-09-07 12:28:39  learning rate schedules on diffusion models, there are several limitations to  
2024-09-07 12:28:39  our study. First, our experiments are limited to 2D datasets, which may not    
2024-09-07 12:28:39  fully capture the complexities of higher-dimensional data. Second, we only     
2024-09-07 12:28:39  consider a few popular learning rate schedules, and there may be other schedul 
2024-09-07 12:28:39  or combinations thereof that could yield better results. Future work could     
2024-09-07 12:28:39  explore these aspects and extend our findings to more complex datasets and     
2024-09-07 12:28:39  models.

2024-09-07 12:28:39  While our experiments provide valuable insights into the impact of different   
2024-09-07 12:28:39  learning rate schedules on diffusion models, there are several limitations to  
2024-09-07 12:28:39  our study. First, our experiments are limited to 2D datasets, which may not    
2024-09-07 12:28:39  fully capture the complexities of higher-dimensional data. Second, we only     
2024-09-07 12:28:39  consider a few popular learning rate schedules, and there may be other schedul 
2024-09-07 12:28:39  or combinations thereof that could yield better results. Future work could     
2024-09-07 12:28:39  explore these aspects and extend our findings to more complex datasets and     
2024-09-07 12:28:39  models.

2024-09-07 12:32:44                                 Experiment Plan                                 
2024-09-07 12:32:44 
2024-09-07 12:32:44 We will conduct a series of experiments to test the effect of conditioning on   
2024-09-07 12:32:44 desired modes in the diffusion model. The experiments will be as follows:       
2024-09-07 12:32:44 
2024-09-07 12:32:44  1 Run 1: Introduce a simple conditional embedding mechanism that takes in a    
2024-09-07 12:32:44    categorical variable representing the desired mode. Use a single mode for    
2024-09-07 12:32:44    conditioning.                                                                
2024-09-07 12:32:44  2 Run 2: Test with two modes for conditioning.                                 
2024-09-07 12:32:44  3 Run 3: Test with three modes for conditioning.                               
2024-09-07 12:32:44  4 Run 4: Test with four modes for conditioning.                                
2024-09-07 12:32:44  5 Run 5: Test with five modes for conditioning.                                
2024-09-07 12:32:44 
2024-09-07 12:32:44                               Implementation Steps                              
2024-09-07 12:32:44 
2024-09-07 12:32:44  1 Modify the MLPDenoiser class to accept an additional conditioning input.     
2024-09-07 12:32:44  2 Introduce a simple conditional embedding mechanism.                          
2024-09-07 12:32:44  3 Adjust the training loop to include these conditioning inputs.               
2024-09-07 12:32:44 
2024-09-07 12:32:44 Let's start with Run 1.

2024-09-07 12:37:12 The error indicates that `config` does not have the attribute `conditioning_dim`. We need to add this attribute to the argument parser in `experiment.py`.
2024-09-07 12:37:12 
2024-09-07 12:37:12 Let's fix this by adding the `conditioning_dim` argument to the parser.

2024-09-07 12:37:19 Description: This run introduces conditioning with 4 modes. The MLPDenoiser model was modified to accept an additional conditioning input, and the training loop was adjusted to include these conditioning inputs. The evaluation focused on whether the model could generate samples biased towards the specified modes.

2024-09-07 12:37:56 
2024-09-07 12:37:56 The error indicates a mismatch in data types between the input tensor and the   
2024-09-07 12:37:56 weights of the linear layer. This is likely because the Legendre polynomial     
2024-09-07 12:37:56 calculations in OrthogonalEmbedding are returning double precision (float64)    
2024-09-07 12:37:56 tensors, while the rest of the model is using single precision (float32)

2024-09-07 12:37:56 
2024-09-07 12:37:56 To fix this, we need to ensure that the embeddings returned by                  
2024-09-07 12:37:56 OrthogonalEmbedding are of type float32. We can achieve this by converting the  
2024-09-07 12:37:56 tensor to the appropriate type within the forward method of the

2024-09-07 13:28:18 The error indicates a mismatch in data types between the input tensor and the weights of the linear layer. This is likely because the Legendre polynomial calculations in `OrthogonalEmbedding` are returning double precision (float64) tensors, while the rest of the model is using single precision (float32) tensors.
2024-09-07 13:28:18 
2024-09-07 13:28:18 To fix this, we need to ensure that the embeddings returned by `OrthogonalEmbedding` are of type `float32`. We can achieve this by converting the tensor to the appropriate type within the `forward` method of the `OrthogonalEmbedding` class.

2024-09-07 15:09:52 To further debug the issue, we need to identify where the NaN values are being introduced. We can add additional checks for NaN values at various stages of the data processing pipeline. Specifically, we should check for NaNs in the `sample` tensor after each step in the diffusion process.
2024-09-07 15:09:52 
2024-09-07 15:09:52 Let's add these checks in the `experiment.py` file:
2024-09-07 15:09:52 
2024-09-07 15:09:52 1. Check for NaNs in the `sample` tensor after each step in the diffusion process.
2024-09-07 15:09:52 2. Add logging to print out the values if NaNs are detected.

2024-09-07 15:09:52                 print(f"NaNs detected in sample at timestep {t[0].item()}")

2024-09-07 15:09:52 This will help us identify if and when NaN values are being introduced during the diffusion process. If NaNs are detected, we can further investigate the source of these NaN values.
