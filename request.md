        "Experiment": "1. Implement Transfer Learning: Modify the training function to include a pre-training phase on a large dataset (e.g., enwik8) followed by fine-tuning on a smaller dataset (e.g., shakespeare_char). This involves loading a pre-trained model checkpoint and continuing training on the new dataset. 2. Implement Multi-Task Learning: Modify the data loading and training loops to alternate between batches from different datasets (e.g., shakespeare_char, enwik8, text8) during training. This requires updating the get_batch function and training loop to handle multiple datasets. 3. Evaluate the performance of models trained with Transfer Learning and Multi-Task Learning against baseline models trained on individual datasets. Metrics such as validation loss, generated text quality, and tokens per second will be used for comparison.",
